This is part of the coursera course project for data science.
* Making changes to the readme file
* Trying to restore them so that they sync and update
* This is logical once you get the hang of it!

## Instructions for push and pull
This is a small section to explain the logic in order once a repo has been created on github and it has been linked to the local version.
*Navigate to the local repo in Gitbash
*git pull origin master - Pulls all github files to local repo.
*Make changes using notepad
*git add . - (Don't foget the space before the full stop!) Adds the changes.
*git commit -m "message on update" - Commits the changes ready to pull.
*git pull origin master - Updates Github with all the changes made.
